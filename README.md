# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I made this project to have a better understanding of different programming languages and to get experience in using tools such as Git and vscode to become a more competent coder. This project is a webpage that will be used throughout my coding bootcamp course to write my notes. Throughout this project, I've learned the functions of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and their importance in building webpages. I have also learned proper procedure in conducting a project to minimize errors and be organized while fulfilling project objectives.
