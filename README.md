# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I made this project to have a better understanding of different programming languages and to get experience in using tools such as Git and vscode to become a more competent coder. This project is a webpage that will be used throughout my coding bootcamp course to write my notes. Throughout this project, I've learned the functions of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and their importance in building webpages. I have also learned proper procedure in conducting a project to minimize errors and be organized while fulfilling project objectives.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
